3 tablespoons Vietnamese ground coffee
(we used Trung Nguyen brand)
▢ 1-3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk (depending on your preference; we used Longevity brand)
▢ 6-8 ounces water that is close to boiling point (depending on your desired coffee strength)
INSTRUCTIONS

We used the Trung Nguyen brand of ground coffee for this Vietnamese coffee recipe, but you can use any good French roast coffee, too.
Our Phin Vietnamese coffee filters are the 6-ounce size, but they come in different sizes depending upon your brewing needs. Alternatively, you can use a French coffee press or your favorite drip coffee method.
Measure 3 tablespoons of ground coffee, and distribute it evenly into the filter.
DO NOT shake the filters or compress the coffee, or the coffee grounds will drop into the holes of the coffee filter and plug up the holes! The result will be that the coffee takes forever to drip, or the grounds may clog the filter entirely. Place the metal filter gently on top of the coffee.
Pour your desired amount of condensed milk into a mug or heatproof glass.
Measure out 6 ounces of near boiling water. Use 8 ounces if you don’t like your coffee with such a strong kick in the pants.
With the filter placed over the glass, pour two tablespoons of hot water into the filter and wait for 5 seconds to "bloom" the coffee. The bloom is the part of the coffee brewing process when the water releases CO2 from the coffee, and the grounds expand.
Next, press on the filter gently to compress the bloomed coffee. This helps slow down the drip rate when you use all of your water, and also makes for a more flavorful coffee.

With these steps, you’ll be able to achieve the optimum brewing time. That said, now slowly pour the rest of the water into the filter, and the coffee will begin dripping into your cup or glass.
Wait about 5 minutes for the coffee to finish drip brewing!
Remove the filter, and stir to mix in the condensed milk.
